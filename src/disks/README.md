The disk 'images' found here were generated by a modified
code gotten from https://github.com/MattisLind/q1decode

The modified code generates an **output.py** file with a
nearly useful python list in it.

The procedure is as follws

    > gcc q1decode.c && cat Q1DISKS/PL1/C_S0T01.000 | ./a.out 255
    > rm -f output.py
    > cat Q1DISKS/PL1/C_S0T01.000 | ./a.out 255

The generated python code needs to be modified to

* ensure that records start at 0
* remove trailing ','s
* wrap the lists elements in a named outer list
