Disk image generation
=====================

The disk 'images' found here were generated by a modified
code gotten from https://github.com/MattisLind/q1decode

The modified code generates an **output.py** file with a
nearly useful python list in it.

The procedure is as follows

.. code-block:: console

    > gcc q1decode.c && cat Q1DISKS/PL1/C_S0T01.000 | ./a.out 255
    > rm -f output.py
    > cat Q1DISKS/PL1/C_S0T01.000 | ./a.out 255

The argument to a.out, in this case 255, must match the record size for that
track. This might not always be known but in theory can be found on the file
index on track 0.

The generated python code needs to be modified to

* ensure that records start at 0
* remove trailing ','s
* wrap the lists elements in a named outer list

So far I have chosen name the list 'data' and put each track in its own
python file (see disks/debugdisk).
