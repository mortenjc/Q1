Emulator Hooks and Helpers
==========================

The z80 emulator currently used is written by Ivan Kosarev.
https://github.com/kosarev/z80

In addition to this a few python modules have been written
to provide useful abstractions:


cpu.py
^^^^^^

Blah.

memory.py
^^^^^^^^^

z8io.py
^^^^^^^

kbd.py
^^^^^^

programs.py
^^^^^^^^^^^

These have then been combined to achieve different functions

disassembly.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

emulator.py
^^^^^^^^^^^
